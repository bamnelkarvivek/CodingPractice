## 🛠 Topics Covered
- Arrays & Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Binary Trees / BST
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Sorting & Searching
- Hashmaps / Dictionaries
- Miscellaneous problems

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repo and run any Python file directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>

python bst/remove.py
```

## 🎯 Purpose
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for technical interviews
- Strengthen fundamentals of data structures & algorithms
- Build a reference library for future use

---

## ✅ Notes
- Solutions are written in **Python 3**.  
- Some problems may have multiple approaches (brute force, optimized, recursive, iterative).  
- This repo is **constantly updated** as I solve more problems.
